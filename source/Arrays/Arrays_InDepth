Array is a collection of same type of elements, It can be of primitive type or custom data type.

In java the array is created dynamically.

Example:
	int size = readIntegerFromInput();
	int array[] = new int[size];
	
You need not explicitly mention then size of array before compilation.

The way arrays are stored in the memory are,
whenever we mention new keyword the space is allocated in the heap and the reference to it is maintained
in the stack

The direct superclass of an array type is Object.
Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable.
